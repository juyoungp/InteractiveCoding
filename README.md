# InteractiveCoding

Hello, I'm Ju Young Park. 
I am a creative coder, and my interests and strengths reside in UX/UI development and data visualization. 
My preferable framework for creative coding is Processing and Openframeworks, but I also work with java, c, and javascript. 
I enjoy trying new software/hardware technology for developing innovative interfaces. 

Thank you.
