This is a data visualization tool for neutron scattering data.
This was created for NASA-JPL/Caltech Data Visualization internship 2015. 

Neutron Scattering Data Viz is a visualizing tool for physicists to interactively explore 5 dimensions of neutron scattering data in 3D space.
It visualizes 5 dimensions of the neutron scattering data with different factors such as x-y-z position, 
color, length and angle in 3D space. It allows users to navigate through visualized volume of data with mouse scrolling and panning.
